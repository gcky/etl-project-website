# Plan for Term 2

With a finalized set of initial requirements and a working skeleton framework of our architecture, our main goal for the next term is to develop our application as per our requirements.  We will be developing features in the order we prioritized our  functional requirements within the MoSCoW framework. The development of each feature will consist of the development of backend and front-end components as well as the integration between the two.

We will continue to be use the Scrum agile development process for managing the project, with weekly sprints and regular client meetings. The Scrum workflow necessitates regular testing throughout development, so we will be conducting unit testing on both our Flask web app and Angular.js front-end, in addition to functional and integration testing on the entire application using the end-to-end testing framework, Protractor.js. During our regular meetings with the client at the end of every sprint, we will will be showcasing the progress we have made. We are also planning on preparing short user acceptance tests before every client meeting, so that all new features we develop during a sprint go through a formal approval process.

If we manage to fulfil all of our requirements ahead of schedule, our first choice is to meet with the client and revisit our requirements to decide on additional features that can be implemented during the remaining time. Our second choice is to focus on the user experience aspect of our application during the remaining time, meaning we beatify the user interface and streamline user interactions.  So far, our clients have expressed more interest in the functionality of our application, so we will most likely go with the first choice in the case that we finish ahead of schedule.
